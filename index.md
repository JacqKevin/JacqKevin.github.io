This site present my works, mainly my thesis work for now, on the use of laboratory hyperspectral imaging applied to sediment cores. 
I use two pushbroom HSI sensors (VNIR and SWIR) of the M2C laboratory (Rouen, France). 
Fusion approaches have been developped to combine this two hyperspectral images. 
Semi-quantitative and quantitave methods were used to reconstruct proxy variations at high-resolution. 
Unsupervised and supervised qualitative methods have also been used to classified the main components in each pixel or the lithology type. 
Image processing approaches need to be developped to automatize lithology description or to separe areas.

If you mention parts of this site, please cite my thesis or the article from which it comes from mentioned at the beginning of the page.
