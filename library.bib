abstract = {The Black Sea has undergone alternating phases of lacustrine and marine environment over geological timescales directly related to its semi-enclosed character and to eustatic sea-level oscillations. During lowstand conditions, as during the last glacial period, the Black Sea was a giant lake disconnected from the global ocean. At that time, Black Sea water-level was controlled by regional climate, and by Eurasian rivers, including the Danube that acted as an outlet of European Ice Sheet and the Alpine ice cap. Thus, the paleo-mouth of the Danube river contains a high quality archive for the study of the paleohydrology of the Danube River and by extension of the European climate changes during the last 30 kyr. For this purpose, we have focused on the GAS-CS01 calypso long-piston core (33.4 m) which was taken during GHASS cruise (Ifremer, 2015) on the upper slope (240 m. depth) at about 25 km east of the Danube Canyon, i.e. in the sediment pile of the Danube paleo-mouth during the last glacial period. Our chronology reveals that core GAS-CS01 extends back to 31 cal kyr BP. The lithology of GAS-CS01 is characterized by clastic rythmites which are presented as a high-resolution Danube runoff proxy. Preliminary results of sedimentological and chronological analysis showed five peaks of terrestrial discharges between ca 31 and 14 ka BP, probably linked to five phases of the enhanced runoff during the studied period. In order to understand the origin and the depositional processes of this laminae, we combined sedimentary analysis (x-ray diffraction, x-ray fluorescence, grain size ...) and hyperspectral images analysis. Hyperspectral imagery is a non-destructive fast method classically used to quantify colour and provides data with high spatial (57-Âµm pixel size) and spectral (3 nm) resolution. The multi-proxy calibration is essential in order to obtain a high-resolution sedimentological dataset. This information allows us to reconstruct the nature and depositional process of the rythmites and thus decipher the Danube paleohydrology during the last 30 kyr.},

abstract = {The aim of this presentation is to overview some applications of hyperspectral imaging for sediment core analysis in paleo-environmental studies. The increase of the sensibility and the resolution of sensors, as well as the development of performant data processing methods allow the analyze of natural sample in a very informative (chemical, physical and biological) and time effective way. Hyperspectral imaging is a method at the interface of spectroscopy and imaging where a spectrum is obtained for each pixel in the sample image. In laboratory conditions, many spectroscopic range can use this kind of method, from the X-ray to the infrared, also fluorescence and Raman. The dataset obtains is called a datacube due to his three dimensions (two spatials and one spectral), a fourth temporal dimension can be added. For that, both methods of image processing and spectral processing methods (chemometrics) can be used independently or together to improve sample knowledge. Quantitative modelling allows to establish a relationship between the spectra and destructive analysis (Particle Size Distribution, RockEval). These supervised models can then theoretically use on other samples without any sampling. Known structures can be discriminating accurately with classification methods, for example lamina or floods, with the labeling of some pixels to a known group. Unknown ones defined by chemical, physical or biological compounds can be determinates with similar methods and then explained by environment hypothesis. For these chemometrics methods, discriminant spectral wavelengths are identified and therefore sediment properties (chemical, physical or biological). Image processing of the core image or of the quantitative or qualitative map can be used to reveal surface structures (instant event, lamina) or local anomalies (coal, grain). The image resolution allows to see structures that the eye cannot see precisely, as infra-millimeter lamina. The use of spectro-spatial methods together and a time model allow to have a chronicle of structural sediment compositions and events. In this study, we use visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging (pixel sizes: 60 and 240 micrometers) and X-Ray Fluorescence spectroscopy (240 micrometer) to analyze the lake Le Bourget sediment core (Savoie, France). Quantitative prediction models have been made for LOI550, Particle Size Distribution and fractions, some RockEval variables with correlation coefficients of the model upper than 0.8 and consistent uncertainties. Lamination counting was also realized with spectral classification methods and image processing, and this is in agreement with eye counting. With these two methods, seasonal variations can be separated in the eutrophic part of the core and compare. Hyperspectral imaging can also be used to find the optimal sampling areas for routine destructive analysis and to create predictive models. The use of several sensors, with data fusion methods, has shown that the increase of the amount of spectro-chemical information allowed to improve the robustness of predictive models. Hyperspectral imaging present already many possibilities to improve our knowledge on natural sample.},

abstract = {Sedimentary archives are used to infer past climate and environment thanks to their physical and chemical properties. Sampling methods (millimetric or centimetric) and routine analysis are time and material consuming. The use of some specific spectroscopic methods and data analysis, allow to develop and perform some robust methods capable of (i) fast high resolution (ii) performed at low costs (iii) non-destructive and (iv) monitor concentration variations of major sediment compounds. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy is one of these techniques, but it is able to detect just mineral geochemistrys. Whereas hyperspectral imaging (VNIR 400-1000 nm, SWIR 1000-2500 nm) allow, behind each voxel (a pixel with several wavelengths), to define spectral fingerprint of organic or mineral chemical compounds. This type of data can be analyzed by statistical techniques. Many (pseudo-) univariate coefficients are available for the quantification of some molecules (RABD845 for BPhe a, RABD660-670 for chlr-a and chlorins). But in this study we choose to applied multivariate methods that take into account all spectra variations. To achieve such study we can use technic that usually applied in classical spectroscopy or for satellite data that can be unsupervised or supervised. For unsupervised techniques, without any prior knowledge of the sample, exploratory algorithms are used to determine groups in the data. Then, these groups can be interpreted with the comparison to other analytical methods. It is possible to find pure signal that corresponds to one or several organic or mineral sedimentary compounds by (i) endmembers techniques, (ii) spectral unmixing, or (iii) clustering. For supervised techniques, we can use the knowledge of sample chemical and physical properties to create prediction models, then it is possible to observe variations of a specific property along the core. To develop qualitative and quantitative model for focused spectral properties we can applied classification and regression techniques. They allow to discriminate spectral domains or some wavelengths for some interest property. In the present study, Lake Le Bourget (Savoie, France) and Black Sea (Northwest margin) sediment cores are used. From this two different environmental systems we could create and test several prediction models. The high-resolution acquisition is done with two hyperspectral cameras: VNIR (400-1000 nm) and SWIR (1000-2500 nm) with spatial resolution of several dozen micrometers. Both sensors are well designed to create predictive models for either physical or chemical properties. In order to improve prediction models and make them more robust, we can pair these two cameras and add XRF core scanner data. For the black sea sediment, we use unsupervised techniques to determine groups and define interesting spatial areas to take samples for analytic analysis. Whereas for the Lake le Bourget sediment, several previous studies allow us to have many available data, thus supervised techniques are used to observe along core variations. For some properties, we could try to use models of the Lake Le Bourget in the Black Sea data, for example if we create a grain-size model, chemical elements ratio or organic compounds.},

Sampling methods (millimetre or centimetre) and routine analyses are destructive and non-spatially resolved methods that consume time and material. Hyperspectral Imaging is a way to have the advantages of spectroscopy (non-destructive, fast analysis) and of imaging (high resolution, information is spatially referenced). coupling hyperspectral imaging with data mining methods makes possible to study several proxies at micrometric scale in each area of the core.Two hyperspectral cameras are used, a Visible-Near InfraRed VNIR (spectral range: 400-1000nm, spatial resolution: 60$\mu$m) and a Short Wave InfraRed SWIR (spectral range: 1000-2500nm, spatial resolution: 189$\mu$m). The two datasets produced can be fused in a unique one used to model environmental proxies. This methodology was achieved on a core from the lake Le Bourget (Western Alps, 53cm long and 9cm width). Quantitative prediction models can be made with partial least squares regression PLSR. This method links spectra with a reference analysis by the creation of a regression model. Assuming a scale homogeneity, it can be spread to all the spectra of the hyperspectral image to predict high spatially resolved proxies. Total Organic Carbon and Grain Size class models have been developed with a validation determination coefficient of 0.86 for TOC and 0.85 for clay. Concentration maps are used to study variation inside each stratigraphic unit event at the scale of laminae.These datasets can be used for classification. Based on pattern recognition and artificial neural network, it is possible to classify the type of lithology defined by the user, for example: summer or winter lamina, floods with labelled areas of less than 1{\%} of the image. For varved sediments, this method can be used to count the varve and apply statistics on them.},

The results show an increase prediction performance rather than data used separately. In the unique cube, the selected wavelength (chlorophyll area (nm), C-H bonds ( nm) and O-H bonds ( nm)) corresponds to those selected by each sensor. Although the analyzes were performed on bulk samples (5 mm x 90 mm x 45 mm slices), the prediction model provides access to the mapping of the surface with a micrometric resolution (the 60$\mu$m pixel can be interpreted as relevant information).},

abstract = {Spectroscopic and imaging sensors are very useful methods in analytical chemistry because they are fast, cost effective, very informative analysis. Recent works search to fused them to create a new sensor with different spectral range to increase spectral and thus chemical information to create robust and precise prediction models. Remote sensing already used fusion methods to increase spatial resolution for spectral sensors. In this paper, we propose to use pixel level data fusion methods on laboratory sensors to check their availability to increase spatial information with low effect on both dimensions (spectral and spatial). The methodology presents two steps, first the registration to fit spatially the sensors and then the fusion step to estimate each sensor at the optimal resolution. The proposed method was used on three sediment cores, that are living sample which can move, crack. They are imaged sequentially with two sensors that do not overlap spectrally: visible near infrared VNIR (400-1000 nm, pixel size: 60 {\$}\mu{\$}m), short wave infrared SWIR (1000-2500 nm, pixel size: 190 {\$}\mu{\$}m). The registration step allows to have a correlation above 0.9 with still spatial defect bring by the samples that cannot be removed. The twenty-one state of the art pixel level data fusion methods seems to be less relevant than a bicubic interpolation for the case of the laboratory hyperspectral images of sediment cores.},

abstract = {The study of sediment cores allows for the reconstruction of past climate and environment through physical-chemical analysis. Nevertheless, this interpretation suffers from many drawbacks that can be overcome with the newest technologies. Hyperspectral imaging is one of these and allows a fast, high resolution, and non-destructive analysis of sediment cores. In this study, we use visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging to predict particle size fractions and distribution (PSD) at a resolution of 200 $\mu$m on a previously well-studied sediment core taken from Lake Bourget (Western Alps, France). These predictions agree with previous studies on this core. Then, the PSD was used to estimate sedimentary deposit sources using the PSD unmixing algorithm AnalySize. It permitted estimation of the contribution of five sources (micrite, small and large bio-induced calcite crystals, diatom frustules, detrital particles), which had previously been characterized. The spatial dimension allowed for laminae to be discretized and counted, in agreement with the age-depth model previously established. We then evaluated the particle size and spectral signatures of each of these annual laminae, hence characterizing their physico-chemical composition. These high-resolution data also allowed for estimation of the accumulation rate (cm/year) of each of the main sources in the laminated unit and inferring the trophic status and the presence of instantaneous events of the lake.},

abstract = {The use of organic proxies increases in paleoenvironmental reconstructions from natural archives. Major advances have been achieved by the development of new highly informative molecular proxies usually linked to specific compounds. While studies focused on targeted compounds, offering a high information degree, advances on bulk organic matter are limited. However, this bulk is the main contributor to carbon cycle and has been shown to be a driver of many mineral or organic compounds transfer and record. Development of target proxies need complementary information on bulk organic matter to understand biases link to controlling factors or analytical methods, and provide a robust interpretation. Fluorescence methods have often been employed to characterize and quantify organic matter. However, these technics are mainly developed for liquid samples, inducing material and resolution loss when working on natural archives (either stalagmite or sediments). High-resolution solid phase fluorescence (SPF) was developed on speleothems. This method allows now to analyse organic matter quality and quantity if procedure to constrain the optical density are adopted. In fact, a calibration method using liquid phase fluorescence (LPF) was developed for speleothem, allowing to quantify organic carbon at high-resolution. We report here an application of such a procedure SPF/LPF measurements on lake sediments. In order to avoid sediment matrix effects on the fluorescence signal, a calibration using LPF measurements was realised. First results using this method provided organic matter quality record of different organic matter compounds (humic-like, protein-like and chlorophylle-like compounds) at high resolution for the sediment core. High resolution organic matter fluxes are obtained in a second time, applying pragmatic chemometrics model (non linear models, partial least square models) on high resolution fluorescence data. SPF method can be considered as a promising tool for high resolution record on organic matter quality and quantity. Potential application of this method will be evocated (lake ecosystem dynamic, changes in trophic levels)},

abstract = {For solids environmental samples, spectroscopic properties can be analyzed but their interpretation is difficult due to the lack of common referential. For the spectroscopic images, pixels are relatively spatially referenced but in most cases, each sensor has his own spatial resolution. The sample used in this work is the first 30cm of a sedimentary core from the Lake Le Bourget (Western Alps), characterized by a stratified area corresponding to last eutrophic conditions of the lake. The aim of this work is to combine four images, (1) two hyperspectral images (9x15cmÂ²): VNIR (98 bands, pixel: 60$\mu$m) and SWIR (144 bands, pixel: 189$\mu$m), and (2) two fluorescence images (2x10cmÂ²; sub-sample of the previous one) using excitation wavelengths of 266nm and 355nm (1024 bands each, pixel: 100$\mu$m). Each hyperspectral data can be resume with a structured grayscale image. With these, it is possible to calculate a micro-deformation model (digital image correlation) and registered them with the same spatial dimension. Applying ARSIS method [1], a pixel level data fusion model is created to fuse all the spectra in a unique spatial cube with the optimal resolution using wavelet spatial transform (decomposition in 4 images: details, vertical, horizontal and diagonal). The new cube can be used as a new instrument. The ARSIS method allows to create a correlation model between the wavelet functions for all the resolution images used. This correlation can be used to add spatial structures to the low spatial resolute data calculated with wavelet transform.},

abstract = {In the case of environmental samples, the use of a chemometrics-based prediction model is highly challenging because of the difficulty in experimentally creating a well-ranged reference sample set. In this study, we present a methodology using short wave infrared hyperspectral imaging to create a partial least squares regression model on a cored sediment sample. It was applied to a sediment core of the well-known Lake Bourget (Western Alps, France) to develop and validate a model for downcore high resolution LOI550 measurements used as a proxy of the organic matter. In lake and marine sediment, the organic matter content is widely used, for example, to reconstruct carbon flux variations through time. Organic matter analysis through routine analysis methods is time- and material-consuming, as well as not spatially resolved. A new instrument based on hyperspectral imaging allows high spatial and spectral resolutions to be acquired all along a sediment core. In this study, we obtain a model characterized by a 0.95 r prediction, with 0.77 wt{\%} of model uncertainty based on 27 relevant wavelengths. The concentration map shows the variation inside each laminae and flood deposit. LOI550 reference values obtained with the loss on ignition are highly correlated to the inc/coh ratio used as a proxy of the organic matter in X-ray fluorescence with a correlation coefficient of 0.81. This ratio is also correlated with the averaged subsampled hyperspectral prediction with a r of 0.65.},
