abstract = {According to an epistemic view of intervals, this paper proposes a possibilistic regression based on gradual interval B-splines to represent the input-output data mapping. In this context, an improvement of the parametric fuzzy regression through the notion of gradual interval B-splines is proposed. The proposed gradual regression based on B-splines can be regarded as an extension of the nonparametric interval-based regression where an uncertain dimension is integrated. The proposed method is validated through illustrative and comparative examples. Moreover, it is applied for modeling the input-output behavior between reflectance and wavelengths in an application for hyperspectral imaging for lake sediments.},

abstract = {The study of sediment cores allows for the reconstruction of past climate and environment through physical-chemical analysis. Nevertheless, this interpretation suffers from many drawbacks that can be overcome with the newest technologies. Hyperspectral imaging is one of these and allows a fast, high resolution, and non-destructive analysis of sediment cores. In this study, we use visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging to predict particle size fractions and distribution (PSD) at a resolution of 200 $\mu$m on a previously well-studied sediment core taken from Lake Bourget (Western Alps, France). These predictions agree with previous studies on this core. Then, the PSD was used to estimate sedimentary deposit sources using the PSD unmixing algorithm AnalySize. It permitted estimation of the contribution of five sources (micrite, small and large bio-induced calcite crystals, diatom frustules, detrital particles), which had previously been characterized. The spatial dimension allowed for laminae to be discretized and counted, in agreement with the age-depth model previously established. We then evaluated the particle size and spectral signatures of each of these annual laminae, hence characterizing their physico-chemical composition. These high-resolution data also allowed for estimation of the accumulation rate (cm/year) of each of the main sources in the laminated unit and inferring the trophic status and the presence of instantaneous events of the lake.},

abstract = {Spectroscopic and imaging sensors are very useful methods in analytical chemistry because they are fast, cost effective, very informative analysis. Recent works search to fused them to create a new sensor with different spectral range to increase spectral and thus chemical information to create robust and precise prediction models. Remote sensing already used fusion methods to increase spatial resolution for spectral sensors. In this paper, we propose to use pixel level data fusion methods on laboratory sensors to check their availability to increase spatial information with low effect on both dimensions (spectral and spatial). The methodology presents two steps, first the registration to fit spatially the sensors and then the fusion step to estimate each sensor at the optimal resolution. The proposed method was used on three sediment cores, that are living sample which can move, crack. They are imaged sequentially with two sensors that do not overlap spectrally: visible near infrared VNIR (400-1000 nm, pixel size: 60 $\mu$m), short wave infrared SWIR (1000-2500 nm, pixel size: 190 $\mu$m). The registration step allows to have a correlation above 0.9 with still spatial defect bring by the samples that cannot be removed. The twenty-one state of the art pixel level data fusion methods seems to be less relevant than a bicubic interpolation for the case of the laboratory hyperspectral images of sediment cores.},

abstract = {In the case of environmental samples, the use of a chemometrics-based prediction model is highly challenging because of the difficulty in experimentally creating a well-ranged reference sample set. In this study, we present a methodology using short wave infrared hyperspectral imaging to create a partial least squares regression model on a cored sediment sample. It was applied to a sediment core of the well-known Lake Bourget (Western Alps, France) to develop and validate a model for downcore high resolution LOI550 measurements used as a proxy of the organic matter. In lake and marine sediment, the organic matter content is widely used, for example, to reconstruct carbon flux variations through time. Organic matter analysis through routine analysis methods is time- and material-consuming, as well as not spatially resolved. A new instrument based on hyperspectral imaging allows high spatial and spectral resolutions to be acquired all along a sediment core. In this study, we obtain a model characterized by a 0.95 r prediction, with 0.77 wt{\%} of model uncertainty based on 27 relevant wavelengths. The concentration map shows the variation inside each laminae and flood deposit. LOI550 reference values obtained with the loss on ignition are highly correlated to the inc/coh ratio used as a proxy of the organic matter in X-ray fluorescence with a correlation coefficient of 0.81. This ratio is also correlated with the averaged subsampled hyperspectral prediction with a r of 0.65.},
