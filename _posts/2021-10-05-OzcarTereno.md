Presentation of hyperspectral imaging work at the Ozcar-Tereno International Conference the October 5-7 2021: "Machine Learning and Deep Learning for retro-observation of Critical Zone processes with hyperspectral imaging".

Abstract:

The study of critical zone processes requires various approaches from the field to the laboratory. Analytical approaches using different sensors allow to characterize this thin and heterogeneous layer of the Earth. While algorithmic approaches based on machine learning and deep learning extract information of interest from these data.

Sedimentary archives are very interesting samples to perform a retro-observation of the CZ. But to characterize them at a fine time scale, high-resolution sensors are needed. This is why hyperspectral imaging is of great interest. It allows to reach a resolution of 50 microns. It is a fast (~10min/m), non-destructive, continuous, automatic, and very informative analytical method. But this high resolution implies a large amount of data that cannot be interpreted manually. This is why automatic machine learning and deep learning methods must be used to extract information of interest. It should be noted that these recent approaches will not supplant the usual methods, and on the contrary, they can use them to learn the specific variations of the sample and also allow for a more accurate reconstruction of the processes within the CZ.

This presentation will show the interest in coupling hyperspectral imagery with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods for the study of CZ, which has already proven to be very effective. ML methods allow the combination of information from usual geochemical analyses with hyperspectral data to estimate them at high resolution with a change from centimetric sampling to micrometric estimation and thus a finer time scale. DL methods allow the integration of multi-dimensional information and therefore learn the spatial-spectral signatures of sedimentary deposits. Currently, these models are specific to what they have learned, so they are site-specific, but as the data increase and become more accessible, they will become more robust to site changes, allowing them to be applied to other uncharacterized sites. ML and DL thus allow to characterize the composition of sedimentary archives thanks to bio-physical-chemical information extracted from the analyzed spectral ranges, and subsequently to reconstruct the CZ processes.
