In collaboration with the Archéorient laboratory, samples from the Orbetello lagoon in Italy were analyzed by hyperspectral imaging. A synthesis of the progress of the work on these samples is available <a href="https://archeorient.hypotheses.org/15957">"here"</a>.

Project:

The URBO project, financed by the LabEx IMU (Intelligences des Mondes Urbains) of the University of Lyon, proposes to analyze the co-evolution of the city of Orbetello, in Tuscany, and its lagoon, from the medieval period until today. If Venice is, in Italy, the most emblematic example of the complex relationship between a city and its lagoon, the case of Orbetello differs in two major aspects (fig.1). First of all, its lagoon is peculiar, in that it is separated from the sea by two almost parallel sandy cordons (tombolos) that connect the ancient island of Monte Argentario to the Tuscan coast, while the city of Orbetello is built on a third, older tombolo, in a central position. The lagoon is currently connected to the sea only by artificial channels. This state of confinement makes it extremely vulnerable to urban, port and industrial development. These have led, in the 20th century, to a deadly eutrophication from which the lagoon is barely recovering.
